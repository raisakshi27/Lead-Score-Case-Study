# Lead-Score-Case-Study
**Lead Scoring Model for X Education – Project Overview**

This project focuses on building a data-driven **lead scoring model** for X Education, an online course provider targeting industry professionals. Although the company receives a large number of leads daily, the **conversion rate is low (around 30%)**. The goal is to help X Education improve their lead conversion rate by identifying high-potential or "hot" leads that the sales team should prioritize, with a target conversion rate of **80%**.

The dataset provided includes around **9,000 historical leads**, each with attributes such as lead source, activity, time spent on the website, and more. The target variable is `Converted`, indicating whether a lead eventually became a paying customer (1) or not (0).

The core objective of this project is to use **logistic regression** to generate a **lead score** (0–100) that reflects the probability of conversion. A higher score suggests a higher likelihood of conversion. This enables the sales team to focus efforts on leads more likely to convert, improving overall efficiency and ROI.

Key tasks in the project:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and irrelevant categories.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Building, training, and evaluating a **logistic regression model**.
- Interpreting results and presenting them through business-friendly visualizations.

Deliverables include:
1. A well-documented Jupyter Notebook with the lead scoring model and evaluation.
2. A Word document addressing specific business scenarios.
3. A concise presentation (PDF) combining business and technical insights.
4. A project summary report (PDF) highlighting the methodology, analysis, and key takeaways.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can drive smarter sales decisions by turning raw lead data into actionable business insights.
